# Complexity rules

- Write many simple expressions

- Avoid deeply nested parentheses and mix of operators

- Have temporary variables for complex expressions

- Early exit for invalid or trivial cases

- Avoid nested control structures

- Simple positive conditionals

- No nested ternary operators or arrow functions

- Keep blocks simple and small (1-4 lines)

- keep cyclomatic complexity below 10
