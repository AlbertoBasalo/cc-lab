# Data rules

- Avoid global variables

- Avoid primitives

- Prefer composition over inheritance

- Avoid large structures

- Encapsulate data and behavior in classes

- Reduce the number of collaborators of each class.

- Reduce the number of consumers of each class.

- DonÂ´t talk to strangers.

- High cohesion (use your data) and low coupling (need few collaborators)

- Keep classes small (50-100 lines)
